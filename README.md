# Construction Site Object Detection using YOLOv8

## Project Overview
This project explores the use of YOLOv8, a cutting-edge deep learning model, for object detection in dynamic construction environments. With an accuracy rate of 82.4%, YOLOv8 surpasses previous iterations, demonstrating its potential for real-time progress monitoring, resource allocation, and safety hazard detection. It achieves a recall of 78.6% and precision of 88.03%, outshining existing solutions and contributing to more efficient construction site management. 

Beyond the metrics, YOLOv8 is applied in automated progress tracking, safety compliance assessments, and real-time resource management.
